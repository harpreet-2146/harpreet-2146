## 👋 Hi, I'm Harpreet!

I'm a student passionate about **Web Development, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, Robotics, IoT,** and exploring multiple domains in **Physics research**. I consider myself a jack of all trades—constantly learning, experimenting, and building across a wide spectrum of technologies.

### 🚀 Current Focus
I'm currently building **Zenith Cortex**—an ambitious, scalable platform designed to empower college communities. Zenith Cortex manages student, mentor, and faculty databases while providing tools for professional growth and allowing recruiters to evaluate students beyond their resumes. It's a creative, fun project, and I'm aiming for a vibrant pastel-themed UI!

### 🛠️ Tech Skills
- **Core Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- **Others:** I love dabbling in new technologies—I'm always exploring!

### 🎨 Personal Preferences
- Fun, creative design with **pastel color palettes**.
